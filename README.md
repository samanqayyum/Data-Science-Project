# Project Metadata

## Project Title:
"Data-Driven Technical Analysis: Machine Learning for Stock Market Prediction and Portfolio Optimization" 

## Project Overview:
This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques for stock market prediction and portfolio optimization. It involves comparing the performance of traditional statistical models with machine learning models to predict stock price movements accurately. Additionally, portfolio optimization techniques will be employed to maximize investment returns based on the predicted prices. It also focuses on analyzing historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance, providing insights into the long-term performance of various companies. Utilizing the yfinance Python library, it simplifies data collection and analysis for stocks. Through detailed metrics including opening and closing prices, the project aims to uncover trends and patterns in the stock market. Overall, it offers a comprehensive view of stock market dynamics and performance over time.

## Objectives:
1. Develop and evaluate machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and potentially SVM for stock price prediction.
2. Compare predictive accuracy against traditional statistical models like Simple Moving Average and Bollinger Bands.
3. Implement portfolio optimization techniques using predicted prices.
4. Analyze the performance of large-cap (Apple, Tesla, Gucci) and mid-cap (Ulta Beauty, Domino's Pizza, Skyworks Solutions) stocks.

## Project DataSet:
Our dataset is sourced from Yahoo Finance, containing daily historical stock prices for prominent companies. This dataset spans over ten years and includes essential attributes like open, close, high, and low prices, along with adjusted close prices and trading volume. The dataset is stored in CSV format for easy accessibility and analysis.

## Installation: 
To get started with the project, clone this repository to your local machine using Git. Once cloned, install the required dependencies by executing pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal. You're now all set to run the main script, DSProject.py, which will execute the project pipeline.

## Project Code:
The project includes the DSProject.py script, which is responsible for data analysis, visualization, and generating insights from the company data.

## Usage:
1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Ensure the CSV files (companyname.csv) are placed in the project directory.
3. Install required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
4. Run the DSProject.py script to perform data analysis and visualization tasks.
